# NextJS STEM demos

This project in part utilizes the [chart.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chart.js) api to build a performant open-source education tool. The available tools encompass anything I have found interesting such as mechanical dynamics or optics, to Electrical Engineering concepts and control theory. So far, the topics covered are:
* **Projectile dynamics**
    * I think back to my years in FIRST Robotics Competitions and I remember wanting to build a close-form solution to many of our projectile woes when we were charged with launching a basketball across a gymnasium. Now demonstrations for a standard projectile along with typical design challenges (canon ball, critical target angle, and max ceiling) are all readily available!
* **Frequency Harmonics**
    * Learn how harmonics are injected into a signal and how they transform the output waveform.
* **Laser Mode Locking**
    *  Explores cavity-modes and mode-locked lasers. The simulation is of a mode-locked laser where the cavity length, the gain medium, and the number of modes centered around the central mode frequency are specified.
* **Radio Modulation Schemes**
* **Transconductance Amplifiers**
    * Understand how many of our current-mode amplifiers can provide a precise current waveform.
* **PID's**
    * Control theory and how parameters affect system dynamics.
* **Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS)**
    * demonstration of phase accumulators, look-up tables, and how we can achieve precision digital oscillators 
* *More as I come up with them...*

## Dependencies
